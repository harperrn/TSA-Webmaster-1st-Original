                        <h3>Personal Hobby Drones</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">There are many types of personal drones that vary from a cheap practice flight drone, to pro flight machines that cost upwards of $1,200. The special thing about hobby drones, are that they are the easiest to fly. Some of the models even fly themselves by integrating a flight GPS into the control system.  </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">The main differences between a cinematography drone and a hobby drone, are the price, and the camera that is attaced to the body of them. You can mount a <a href="http://shop.gopro.com/">GoPro</a> or a camera is included like the <a href="http://www.dji.com/products/phantom-3-series">DJI Phantom</a>. These type of UASs can also be custom built from frames and motors. These are usually what are used for professional productions.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Search and rescue drones are special because they have at least one type of thermal imaging device. They are usually controlled by the pilot via First Person View (FPV). They use their thermal sensors to track people, and find thermal signatures. They can also geotag the locations of the data that is collected. </p> <br>

                        <p class="text-muted">3D mapping drones are special because they have laser beams that can scan the surface that they are flying over, and send it to the pilot to be saved on a storage medium. These types of air systems also fly very steady so that there are less or no imperfections in the scan. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Checking on crops by use of a drone has become very popular recently. Farmers or inspectors are able to see their crops from the air, and determine if they need to be harvested or watered. They are also able to make sure that all of the irrigation systems are working properly, or farm hands are doing what they are supposed to.</p> <br>

                        <p class="text-muted">Police/crowd control drones can be flown by the pilot from a safe distance away from the targeted subject. Police drones are fast, and can contain a tazer, and can close in on the subject from a safe distance. Crowd control air systems are usually endurance oriented, and can fly for long periods of time.  </p> <br>

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        <br>
                    <h4 class="build-info">Materials:</h4>
                        <br>
                        - Body: The body of the drone can be anything you want. It just needs to be lightweight and sturdy. Your frame needs to be able to mount either four or six motors, and their ESCs. Saying that, the frame needs to weigh the same on all sides. The one that we will be using and reccomending is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hobbyking-X650F-Glass-Fiber-Quadcopter/dp/B00USR0AGO/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1442096059&sr=1-2&keywords=quadcopter+frame">Hobbyking X650F</a> because it has foldable arms, and a hightened landing gear that allows it to have a camera mounted under it. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - ESC: The Electronic Speed Controller is an integrated circuit that allows each of the motors to be controlled indevidually by the flight controller. There needs to be one ESC for each motor that you have on your quadcopter, and they are all connected to the power distribution board. They can also be homemade. We will be unsing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gartt-Brushless-Outrunner-Quadcopter-SKYWALKER/dp/B00JFR4YEC/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1442097459&sr=8-9&keywords=quadcopter+motors">Gartt 2212</a> because it comes with motors, and has simon-k firmware.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Motors and Propellers: The motors and propellers work in tandem from the power of the ESC to lift the quad off of the ground. The motors that we will be using are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gartt-Brushless-Outrunner-Quadcopter-SKYWALKER/dp/B00JFR4YEC/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1442097459&sr=8-9&keywords=quadcopter+motors">Gart 2212</a> because it comes with the ESCs, and they have more than enough power to fly with a camera attached to the frame. The propellers that we will be using are the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hooshion%C2%AE-Carbon-Propeller-Multirotor-Quadcopter/dp/B00ZQHZ5U2/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1442098409&sr=8-10&keywords=quadcopter+propellers+6+in">Hooshion Carbon Fiber 5in</a> propellers that come in a four pack. They also have a five-inch blade length that produce more air-power. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Flight controllers, PDBs, and gps/ radio controller boards: The flight controller is the middleman between the radio controller board and the ESCs. It controls the ESCs to control the motors. They can also control a camera or a gimbal, and the other outputs can be programmed to do whatever you want. The flight controller that we will be using is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Andoer-Flight-Controller-Multicopter-Quadcopter/dp/B00Q496EOM/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1442098903&sr=8-8&keywords=quadcopter+flight+controller">Andoer APM 2.6</a> because it is flashable, and it is compatible with a GPS unit.
                        <br>
                        Next up is the PDB or Power Distribution Board. This is a simple little peice of electronics that takes the power from the battery(ies) and distributes it to the flight controller and ESCs. The PDB that we will be using is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quadcopter-Power-Distribution-Board-Mutlicopter/dp/B00QGCILK2/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1442099164&sr=1-1&keywords=quadcopter+power+distribution+board">QPDB XT60</a> because it has simple and reliable circuits and pre-soldered bullet plugs. We will also need some bullet plugs to go on the ESCs with this. We wil just use these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plated-Female-Bullet-Connector-Battery/dp/B00T5SW78G/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1442099405&sr=1-2&keywords=bullet+plugs+3.5mm">BW Gold Plated 3.5mm Bullet Plugs</a>.
                        <br>
                        GPS is the next thing to concider when you are looking at this quadcopter build. There are two options when you are looking at the GPS unit. The Arduino, or a GPS unit that works with you flight controller. GPS is important becuase it can help fly the quad. You can put the quad into hover mode, and allow it to fly itself, or even program a flight path and let it do its thing. The GPS unit that we will be using is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Andoer-Precision-Multirotor-Quadcopter-Controller/dp/B00N3TE312/ref=pd_sim_21_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1HN72A9AJ0BFSGEBJSK3&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_">Andoer Ublox NEO-6M</a>. It is also compatible with our flight controller.
